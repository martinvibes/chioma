- **User Activity Timeline (#416):** Integrated `ActivityTimeline` into `AdminUserDetailView` with filtering, pagination (10/page), and chronological sorting.
- **Contract Error Reference (#744):** Created [ERROR-REFERENCE.md](file:///home/solodev/Documents/dripsNetwork/chioma/contract/docs/reference/ERROR-REFERENCE.md) documenting core protocol error codes.
- **Profile Image Fixes (#771, #772):**
    - Fixed hardcoded `/avatar.png` in `AdminSidebar` and `AdminTopbar`.
    - Implemented dynamic avatar loading with fallbacks in User dashboard `Topbar`.
