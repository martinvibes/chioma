# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### ⚠️ DO NOT

- **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- **Do NOT** post about the vulnerability on social media
- **Do NOT** disclose the vulnerability before we have time to fix it

### ✅ DO

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing **security@chioma.dev** with:

1. **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Location** - Affected component and code location
3. **Reproduction Steps** - How to reproduce the issue
4. **Impact** - Potential impact of the vulnerability
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have one

### GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

Alternatively, you can use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the vulnerability details
4. Submit the report

## Security Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## Supported Versions

| Version | Status  | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1.x     | Current | ✅ Yes           |
| 0.x     | Legacy  | ⚠️ Limited       |

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

2. **Validate all inputs**
   - Validate user input on both frontend and backend
   - Use type validation (TypeScript, Zod, class-validator)
   - Sanitize data before storing

3. **Use secure authentication**
   - Use JWT with expiration
   - Implement refresh token rotation
   - Use HTTPS only

4. **Encrypt sensitive data**
   - Encrypt PII at rest
   - Use HTTPS for data in transit
   - Use secure hashing for passwords

5. **Follow OWASP guidelines**
   - Prevent SQL injection
   - Prevent XSS attacks
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Use secure headers

### For Deployments

1. **Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   # Never commit these
   DATABASE_URL
   JWT_SECRET
   API_KEYS
   ENCRYPTION_KEYS
   ```

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Restrict database access
   - Enable encryption at rest
   - Regular backups

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration
   - Request validation
   - Error handling (don't leak sensitive info)

4. **Blockchain Security**
   - Secure key management
   - Multi-signature for critical operations
   - Audit smart contracts
   - Test on testnet first

## Security Scanning

We use automated security scanning:

- **Trivy** - Vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint** - Code quality and security
- **Clippy** - Rust security linting
- **Dependabot** - Dependency updates

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Action**
   - Disable affected functionality
   - Notify affected users
   - Begin investigation

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact

3. **Remediation**
   - Develop and test fix
   - Deploy fix
   - Verify resolution

4. **Communication**
   - Notify users
   - Publish security advisory
   - Document lessons learned
